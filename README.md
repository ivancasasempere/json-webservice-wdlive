JSON formatted Web Service API to expose [Weather Display Live](http://www.weather-display.com/wdlive.php) data. Written in PHP.

## Overview

json-webservice-wdlive exposes much of a weather station's Weather Display Live (WDL) data as a simple JSON formatted Web Service API.

It exposes two URLs. The first returns current weather conditions including Temperature, Pressure, Rainfall, Wind, Humidity, Dew Point, Wind Chill, Humidex, Heat Index and UV. The second returns a weather almanac for Month-to-Date, Year-to-Date and All Time records.

Besides exposing the data in the default units found in clientraw the responses also contain many alternative units. For example, clientraw files store wind speeds in knots. The Web Service responses, on the other hand, respond with Bft, knots, km/h, mph, and m/s.

I only expose the data I am interested in for my own purposes (i.e. what my weather station setup supports). However, it would be a simply matter to expand the service calls to add, say, solar measurements or extend the selection of almanac measurements.

## Requirements

1. [Weather Display](http://www.weather-display.com) (or equivalent such as [MeteoHub](http://wiki.meteohub.de)) configured to periodically upload WDL clientraw files to a web server
2. PHP5 installed on the web server

## Installation

* Clone the PHP source from github:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/waynedgrant/json-webservice-wdlive.git
```

* Upload all json-webservice-wdlive .php and .json files to the same directory as clientraw files are hosted on your web server
* Modify your web server to process .json files using PHP. For example, for Apache add the following to your .htaccess file:

```
AddHandler application/x-httpd-php5 .json
```

Note: If you want to setup json-webservice-wdlive be in a different directory from your clientraw files than simply edit the **$client_raw_directory** variable in the **common.php** file supplying the appropriate relative path.

## Execution

Hit the URL of your deployed .json files using a web browser or other REST client. Both JSON and JSONP are supported.

For example:

**Current Weather URL - weather.json**

JSON:
[http://www.waynedgrant.com/weather/api/weather.json](http://www.waynedgrant.com/weather/api/weather.json)

JSONP:
[http://www.waynedgrant.com/weather/api/weather.json?callback=weatherCallback](http://www.waynedgrant.com/weather/api/weather.json?callback=weatherCallback)

**Weather Almanac URL - almanac.json**

JSON:
[http://www.waynedgrant.com/weather/api/almanac.json](http://www.waynedgrant.com/weather/api/almanac.json)

JSONP:
[http://www.waynedgrant.com/weather/api/almanac.json?callback=weatherCallback](http://www.waynedgrant.com/weather/api/almanac.json?callback=weatherCallback)
